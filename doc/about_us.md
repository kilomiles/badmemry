My name is Hardarshan Kahlon but I like to go by Harmen. Iâ€™m a 4th year Computer Science specialist student with interests in community engagement through programming and the business aspect of computer science, hence why I am doing a focus in video game design and a minor in economics. In this project, I will utilize my past experience in HTML, PHP, CSS and SQL to contribute towards the development of the webpage, the use of the database and more. In the past, I have worked as a teaching assistant in first year computer science courses but at the moment, I am a full-time student. Some of skills include working well within the structure of a team, whether that involves taking directives or providing my expertise, time management and being clutch (seriously). Due to the fact that many of the technologies that we will use in this project are new to all of the group members, I expect there to be solid challenges but I, along with my teammates, am determined to overcome them and release an excellent product.

Serguei Makarov is a fourth year computer science student at UofT, with a longtime interest in languages (whether programming languages, or the more messy kind) and computerized learning. He was surprised and delighted that all of these interests would come in handy for a CSC309 project, of all things, and is looking forward to making the language-study application that he wishes he had several years ago.

Kevin Zhang is a fourth year Electrical and Computer Engineer at UofT, currently on his Professional Experience Year. He loves software and how it is reshaping the world around us. This will be Kevin's first foray into the world of web programming and he looks forward to building a souped-up version of Anki!
