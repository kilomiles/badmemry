<h2>This is the repository for our CSC309 Project 2. </h2>

<h3>Each member has completed the following parts:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hardarshan Kahlon: </strong>Designing sentences interface to allow user to input a webpage to retrieve and then display the retrieved data to user. + Getting data from webpages by scraping and then filtering/cleaning it. + Putting page & sentence data into the database. + SRS stuff with Miles.</li>
  <li><strong>Miles Gilchrist: </strong>HeatMap (language detection, collecting definitions and sample sentences and database integration with words table) + work on static Jade files + helping with SRS</li>
  <li><strong>Kevin Zhang: </strong>Account signup and authentication. Profile information updates and profile deletion. Setup of user_info table. Routing and serverside programming. local postgres database setup. polishing jade templates. basic SRS algorithm</li>
  <li><strong>Serhei Makarov: </strong>Setting up database, locally and through Heroku. + Completed tables views. Set up much of the structure of the app like the routing and design principles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our gameplan and how it turned out</h3>

<p>Most of the peripheral functions of the app (like getting data from other websites to analyze, managing database, user authentication, translations/definitions of sentences and words, and more) have been completed.</p>

<p>The SRS algorithm itself is implemented in the design. The only function missing is that once a user has reviewed a sentence and graded it accordingly, the insertion back into the database has not been completed. At the present moment, we simply display a pop-up which demonstrates that the algorithm works by displaying the new eFactor, interval number and qualityGrade after running the algorithm.</p>

<p>In the third phase of the project, we will add the functionality to update the sentence attributes in the Sentences table in the database. Additionally, we will handle any other small touchups and security issues, if they arise.</p>
